PROJECT: Cluster the location of weather stations in Canada which show the same weather condition.

DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
This technique is one of the most common clustering algorithms which works based on density of object.

It works on two parameters:
1) Epsilon--> determine a specified radius that if includes enough number of points within, we call it dense area
2) Minumum samples --> determine the minimum number of data points we want in a neighborhood to define a cluster
